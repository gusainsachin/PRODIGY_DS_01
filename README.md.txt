                                          Gender and Age Distribution Visualization

This project is designed to visualize the distribution of gender and age within a sample population using Python libraries.

Dataset Description:
The dataset contains information for 30 individuals. For each person, three details are provided:

  -A serial number from 1 to 30.

  -Their age.

  -Their gender (either Male or Female).

What the Code Does:
  Creates a Dataset:
    A small dataset is manually created containing ages and gender of 30 people.

  Gender Distribution Chart:
   The first visualization is a bar chart that shows how many males and how many females are in the dataset. Each gender is represented     by a different color. This helps in quickly understanding the gender balance in the population.

Age Distribution Chart:
    The second visualization is a histogram. It groups the ages into ranges (called bins) and shows how many people fall into each range. This is useful for seeing the overall age pattern in the population, such as which age groups are most common.

Tools Used:
  -Pandas is used to create and manage the dataset.
  -Matplotlib is used to create the visual charts.
